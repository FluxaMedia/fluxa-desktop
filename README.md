## What it does

Fluxa connects to any Stremio-compatible addon and turns it into a proper desktop app: a home feed with genre and category browsing, a calendar of upcoming episodes, a library with continue-watching and resume positions, and two-way watch tracking with Trakt, MyAnimeList, and Simkl. Playback runs through `libmpv`, including direct torrent/magnet support, with no telemetry.

## Features

- **Catalogs & discovery** — home feed, genre/category grids, search across every installed addon, and a calendar of upcoming episodes for what you're following
- **Library** — watchlist, continue watching with resume position, and custom collections, with import support for existing lists
- **Watch tracking** — two-way sync with Trakt, MyAnimeList, and Simkl
- **Playback** — subtitle and audio track selection, intro/outro/recap skip, and direct torrent/magnet support
- **Profiles** — multiple local profiles on one install, each with its own library, addons, and sync accounts
- **Addons** — install and manage Stremio-compatible addons directly from the app
- **Auto-update** — checks for and installs new versions in-app
